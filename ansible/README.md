This project deploys simple and dumb web app on infrastructure created by Terraform. 
This web app pulled from my public docker repository.
First we need to prepare inventory file with VMs addresses. 
Terraform config has defined "VMs_addresses" output, so it can be called by 'terraform output VMs_addresses'.
But it easier to use 'terraform-inventory' utility. It can be installed from 'https://github.com/adammck/terraform-inventory'.
'make deploy' includes 'terraform-inventory' command to generate inventory from Terraform state file and then run ansible playbook.
Inventory 'hosts.ini' also should be already generated by 'make up' at previous Terraform step but it ok to rewrite it.
Also Ansible playbook will install Datadog agent on VMs. So it needed to define datadog_api_key in 'ansible_secrets.yaml' file. You will need account at "datadoghq.eu" obviously.
Also Ansible playbook will configure systemd timer to perform Upmon check. So it needed to define personal Upmon url in 'ansible_secrets.yaml' file. You will need account at "upmon.com" obviously.
